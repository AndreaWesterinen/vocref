<title>OWL 2 Ontology of Ontology Evaluation</title>
<h1>OWL 2 Ontology of Ontology Evaluation</h1>

<p>This directory contains an OWL 2 representation of the Ontology of
Ontology Evaluation which is intended to be faithful to the conceptual
drawings developed during the HC-05 hackathon.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle</a> file corresponds to each of the
drawings.  <a href="evaluation.ttl">evaluation.ttl</a> imports all of
the other files.</p>

<p>These files were tested using Protege 4.2.0 (Build 295), available
at <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu">protege.stanford.edu</a>.
Each is self-contained (resulting in some duplicate class definitions,
which isn't a problem).  All the files use the
same <a href="http://ontolog.cim3.net/file/work/OntologySummit2013/Hackathon-Clinics/HC-05_Ontology-of-OntologyEvaluation/owl/evaluation">http://ontolog.cim3.net/file/work/OntologySummit2013/Hackathon-Clinics/HC-05_Ontology-of-OntologyEvaluation/owl/evaluation</a>
namespace, which is resolvable modulo HTTP content negotiation.</p>

<p>Below we discuss some of the decisions made andissues encountered
in developing this OWL 2 representation.  Many are generally
applicable to other representations.  Some of the files also
contain <tt>TODO</tt> comments.</p>

<h2>Associating Value Types with Properties</h2>

<p>

<p>We make heavy use of <tt>owl:allValuesFrom</tt> restrictions (OWL's
version of FOL <tt>forall</tt>), which are essentially class-specific
versions of <tt>rdfs:range</tt>.  Many of our properties are reused (a
good thing), so <tt>rdfs:range</tt> is generally too restrictive.</p>

<p>We should verify that such restrictions are appropriate, both
within and potentially outside the ontology.  For instance, agents can
potentially manage many things (ontology requirements, people,
companies, etc.).  In some cases, it may be more appropriate to use
the inverse of the property, e.g. an ontology requirement is managed
by an agent.</p>

<h2>Associating Multiple Value Types with Properties</h2>

<p>In some cases, a class uses the same property (e.g. defines) with
values of multiple types.  We generally model this using
an <tt>owl:allValuesFrom</tt> restriction to an
anonymous <tt>owl:unionOf</tt> class. The disadvantage of this
approach is that <tt>owl:unionOf</tt> closes off its list of classes
(e.g. additional value types can't be added elsewhere).  Again, we
should ensure that such restrictions are appropriate, both within and
potentially outside the ontology.  It may be necessary to merge lists
or use less constrained restrictions.</p>

<p><tt>owl:someValuesFrom</tt> restrictions (OWL's version of
FOL <tt>exists</tt>) can be used to indicate that a property has some
(but not necessarily all) values of a given type, but it also
implies <tt>owl:minCardinality</tt> 1, which may not be
appropriate in many cases.</p>

<h2>Loosely Associating Properties with Classes</h2>

<p>It's often useful (e.g. to human readers or GUIs) to indicate that
a given property is relevant to a class even if we're not able to say
anything more about it.</p>

<p>A tautological <tt>owl:minQualifiedCardinality</tt> 0 restriction
can be used to associate a property relating 2 classes without XXX.
Qualified cardinality restrictions were added in OWL 2.</p>

<p>Similarly, a tautological <tt>owl:minCardinality</tt> 0 statement can be used to associate a property with a class without specifying the type of its value.</p>

<h2>Cardinalities</h2>

<p>The conceptual diagrams do not specify cardinalities, so we don't
otherwise specify them.  Cardinalities should presumably be specified,
where appropriate, as the ontology is refined.</p>

<h2>Ontology Characteristics</h2>

TBD classes vs. instances.  punning.  restrictions.
